# Sudoku Solver
### Introduction
- Sudoku Board is a logic - based, number placement puzzle
- Each row, column and 3x3 sub-grid should have a unique combination of 1-9 digits
- There should be no repetition in any row, column or sub-grid

### Motivation
- In advanced algorithms class introduced the concept of recursion and backtracking based algorithms
- Submitted a Sudoku Solver as a class project for the advanced algorithms class
- Which generated a random Sudoku Board, removed a set number of elements from the board and returned a solved Sudoku Board

### Backtracking based algorithm
- Algorithmic-technique for solving problems recursively by trying to build a solution incrementally, one piece at a time
- Removing those solutions that fail to satisfy the constraints of the problem at any point of time
- In Sudoku solving puzzle, we try filling digits one by one. Whenever we find that current digit cannot lead to a solution, we remove it (backtrack) and try next digit

### Backtracking by example
### Generating a Sudoku Board
### Approach
### Generating a playable board
### Method 2
### Building a responsive UI
### Components
### Redux store
### Reducers - Action Types
### React Hooks with Mousetrap
